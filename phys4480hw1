1a.
r1 = 1.87425e-07
r2 = 8.57282e-10

x1 is the more accurate solution but has a larger residual.

1b.
xlu = (1.00217, -1.00295)
LU decomp error = 0.00366587
residual for LU Decomp = 6.20634e-17

You do not get the full machine accuracy in this solution since I have it set to round doubles after 8 decimal places
and it is possible to get accuracy beyond that.

The residual is significantly smaller than the error by a factor of 14.

1c.
Cond(A) = 9.03064e+13

The condition number of A is very large. Since the relative error in the solution is approximately cond(A) times the relative
error in the residual, this would explain why the two errors are so far off in parts a and b.

2a.
r=568467

2b.
r=116681

2c.
r=116681

2d.
There is about a factor of 5 difference in the errors of the LU and inverse methods which is a slightly bigger difference
than I would expect based on the number of floating point operations required of the algorithms (the two have a difference
of only about 3 in floating point operations).

Cond(A)=17778

The condition number of A is relatively high (in the ten thousands) so I am not surprised that the errors are also
relatively high (in the hundred thousands).
